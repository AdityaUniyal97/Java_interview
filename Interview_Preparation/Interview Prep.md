I am highly focused and dedicated to completing any task which i take up . In addition , I have good logical thinkinh and enjoy solving problems - especially those which requires algorithms and code debugging

**What are your Weakness**
I belive one of my wekness is that I sometimes spend too much time trying to make my work perfect , which can sometimes delay the complition of taks . I have relized that whil quality is importat , it is equallly important to manage time effoectively , I am now working on and give priority to important task and focusing on the output rather than getting stuck in perfection

## Share you memory or any funny moment at college
One of the funny mmoment which happened is during my college group presentation , where we rehersed everything , but during the live demo instead of running the code, my friend accidently played the video throguh which we have rehressed , .Everyone including our faculty laughed , they appreciated our work after we fixed it

**How do yoy handle pressure or stressful situations ?**
When i under the pressure i try to remain calm and focused . I break the problem into smaller step andstart solving one fo them at a time . for example During my college deadlines , I used to create a todo list giving priority to important task and avoiding distractions , This helped me stay productive even in challeneging situation

**Where do you see yourself in next 5 years**
In the next five year i see myself becoming a skilled software developer with strong problem - solving and technical capabilites . I would like to take more responsibilites , and maybe take a small initiative to lead a small team  and work on a challenging real world project . My goat is to grow personally and professionally 

## Tell me about your hobies
My hobies are playing football and cycling , Football helps me improve focus , and team cordination , while cycling gives me mental referse and keeps me physically active.

**What motivates you ?**
I am motivates by challenges ad oopportunies to leanr new thing . Whenvenr i learn a new concept or succesfully build a project or solve a coding problem , it gives me  a sense of accomplishment and  keep myself motivated

**are you willing to reallocate**
Yes i am complelty open to reallocate . I understadn that working in IT industry requires flixiblity and i see relocation as an i apportunity to explore new cities , meet new people and gain expirence to different work culture

**Do you have any question for us**
Yes i would like to know more about the training process at caognizant for fresher . what kind of technolgies or domain do fresher usulally get assinged during initial phase

**Tell me about a time you worked in a team**
In my last semster i have worked on a project called "Study Notion" I collaborated with two of my classmater . We than divied the task . I was responsibe for coding the algorithm , one fo my friends desinged the user interface and the other handled the documentation . We had regular discussions to stay on the same pace and supported each other when someonw got stuck . this expirence taought how communciation adn teamwork can help us deliver the projects more effectiviely

**DBMS** A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that helps in storing, retrieving, and managing data in databases. It provides a structured way to organize data using tables, schemas, and relationships. It also ensures data security, integrity Example = MySql,Oracle 

****Difference between DBMS and RDBMS?**    
DBMS stores data in files and can be unstructured, whereas RDBMS stores data in the form of structured tables (rows and columns). RDBMS follows relational models and uses primary and foreign keys to maintain relationships between tables.

**What is a Primary Key?** **
A Primary Key is a column (or a set of columns) in a database table that uniquely identifies each row. It cannot contain NULL values or duplicate data. For example, in a student table, the `student_id` can be the primary key because each student has a unique ID.
**What is the FOregn Key**
It is used to connect two tables
**Candidate Key** All keys that can uniquekly identify each row 
**Composite Key** Combination of two or fields to unquelky identify a row
Alternate Key = Candidate Key which are not primary key

**Normalisation** is the process of organising the data into table(in the form of rows and column) to avoid data redundancy , and data integrity

**What is SQL** SQL is used communicate with the datqa base

# **Project**

# Study Notion
Study Notion is a Learning Managemement System(LMS)
It is a web platform where student can enroll themselv to a course and  teacher can add , edit and delete these courses


# Sortest Path Visulaiser
My project is Shortest Path Finder using Dijkstra Algorithm. It findes the smallest distance between the two points at the graph . I wrote its logic in the java language. The user gives the graph as input and my project finds the shortest point from start to end
It help me learn about the grpah , algorithms and how to solve the real world problems
**What is Dijkstra algorithm** finds the shortest way from one point to all other points in a graph . First it mark the starting point distance as 0 and other nodes as Infinity . than it picks the nearest node okay update the distance from start to end , and keep repating this process until all the nodes are marked as visited
**Why Dijkstra.s ALgorithm** So dijskrta algo find the shortes path correctly when there are no negative weights and it is also used in real apps like Google Maps
**What data structures you have used** 
1) Priority Queue / Heap = to pick the nearest point fast
2) Adjacency List = to store the graph 
3) Arrays or Maps = to store the distance and parent
**What problems** 
- How to use priority ques properly
- How to handle the graph which are not coneectd
- How to show the correct shortest path


**What is java** platform indipendent language  Java is pouplar high level object oriented programming langauge . It is used to make software , website and apps and game . One of the major advantage of java programming is that we cna write code once and the same code can be run one any device 

**jDK , JRE , JVM** 
JVM = Java Vertual kit = provide the environemtn for running program
JRE = JVm + other libraries which are need to run
JVM = is the complete package that uns the java program

**ByteCode**
Bytecode is the compiler generated code which JVM understand . It is not machine code and represented by .class file
Javafile => compiler => Bytecode => Run on JVm
