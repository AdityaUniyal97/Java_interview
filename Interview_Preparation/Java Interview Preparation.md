# Java Programming Notes

---

### Java Overview
Java is a popular programming language created by **James Gosling**. Known for its versatility, Java is widely used in fields such as web applications, scientific computing, supercomputers, and more.

---

## 1. Is Java Platform Independent? How?

Java is platform-independent. When Java code is compiled, it is converted into **bytecode** (a `.class` file). This bytecode can run on any system with a **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)** installed, regardless of the underlying hardware or operating system.

---

## 2. What are the Top Java Features?

Java’s popularity stems from its key features:

- **Simple**: Straightforward syntax, easy to learn.
- **Platform Independent**: Can run on any system with JVM.
- **Robust**: Garbage collection and exception handling make it reliable.
- **Object-Oriented**: Fully supports OOP concepts like classes and objects.

---

## 3. What is JVM?

The **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)** is a part of the JRE, translating Java bytecode into machine code for execution on the host machine.

---

## 4. What is JIT?

**JIT (Just-in-Time) Compiler**: A component of the JRE that improves Java performance by compiling bytecode into machine code during runtime.

---

## 5. Difference Between JVM, JRE, and JDK

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **JVM**   | Converts bytecode to machine code for execution. |
| **JRE**   | Java Runtime Environment; includes libraries and JVM to run Java programs. |
| **JDK**   | Java Development Kit; includes JRE and development tools to create Java programs. |

---

## 6. Java vs. C++

| Basis       | C++                   | Java                      |
|-------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|
| Platform    | Platform Dependent    | Platform Independent      |
| Application | System Programming    | Application Programming   |

---

## 7. Explain `public static void main(String[] args)` in Java

- **public**: Globally accessible.
- **static**: Allows the method to run without creating an instance.
- **void**: No return value.
- **main**: The entry point of the program.
- **String[] args**: Command-line arguments.

---

## 8. What Happens if `main` is Not Static?

The program will not execute correctly since the JVM won’t recognize it as the entry point.

---

## 9. What are Packages in Java?

Packages group related classes and interfaces together, making code manageable and preventing name conflicts.

---

## 10. Data Types in Java
Data Type define the type and the size of the value which a variable will store.
### 1. **Primitive Data Types**
Store single values with no special capabilities:
- **boolean**: `true` or `false`
- **byte**: 8-bit integer
- **char**: 16-bit Unicode character
- **short**: 16-bit integer
- **int**: 32-bit integer
- **long**: 64-bit integer
- **float**: 32-bit floating point
- **double**: 64-bit floating point

### 2. **Non-Primitive Data Types**
Non-primitive data types store references to memory locations, unlike primitive types which directly hold values
- **String**
- **Array**
- **Class**
- **Object**
- **Interface**

---

## 11. Can We Use Pointers in Java?

No, Java does not support pointers, which ensures security and prevents direct memory access.

---

## 12. What is the Wrapper Class in Java?

Wrapper classes convert primitives into objects, for example, `int` to `Integer`. They support **autoboxing** and **unboxing**:

```java
int num = 5;
Integer numObj = Integer.valueOf(num);  // Autoboxing
int numPrim = numObj.intValue();        // Unboxing
```

---

## 13. Instance vs. Local Variables

| Instance Variable                       | Local Variable                    |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Declared outside methods.               | Declared within a method.         |
| Has a default value.                    | No default value.                 |
| Accessible throughout the class.        | Scope limited to the method.      |

---

## 14. What is a Class Variable?

A **class variable** (static variable) is shared by all instances of a class:

```java
class A {
    static int CHAR = 200;
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(CHAR);
    }
}
```

---

## 15. Difference Between `print`, `println`, and `printf`

- **print**: Outputs without moving to the next line.
- **println**: Outputs and moves to the next line.
- **printf**: Outputs in a formatted way.

---

## 16. What are Operators in Java?

- **Arithmetic**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- **Relational**: `==`, `>`, `<`
- **Logical**: `&&`, `||`, `!`
- **Assignment**: `=`, `+=`
- **Unary**: `++`, `--`
- **Bitwise**: `&`, `|`, `^`

---

## 17. Arrays in Java

An array stores multiple elements of the same type.

- **Fixed-size Arrays**:
  ```java
  int arr[] = {10, 15, 30};
  int[] arr = new int[100];
  ```

- **Dynamic Arrays** (using `ArrayList`):
  ```java
  ArrayList<Integer> al = new ArrayList<>();
  al.add(10);
  al.add(20);
  ```

### Advantages
1. **Fast access** via indexing.
2. **Cache-friendly** memory layout.

### Disadvantages
1. **Fixed size** after declaration.
2. **Inefficient insertion/deletion**.

---

## 18. What is a Jagged Array?

A **Jagged Array** is a 2D array with rows of varying lengths:

```java
int[][] jaggedArray = {
    {1, 2},
    {3, 4, 5},
    {6, 7, 8, 9}
};
```

---

## 19. What are Classes in Java?

A class is like a custom data type with variables and functions. Example:

```java
class A {
    int real, imag;
    A(int r, int i) {
        real = r;
        imag = i;
    }
    void add(A obj) {
        real += obj.real;
        imag += obj.imag;
    }
    void print() {
        System.out.println(real + " + " + imag + "i");
    }
}
```

---

## 20. Difference Between Static (Class) and Instance Methods

| Static Method                | Instance Method               |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Belongs to the class.        | Belongs to an object.         |
| Called using class name.     | Called using an object.       |
| Can only access static members.| Can access both static and instance members.|

---

## 21. What is the `this` Keyword in Java?

`this` refers to the current object instance:

```java
class Point {
    int x, y;
    Point(int x, int y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }
}
```

---

## 22. Access Specifiers in Java

1. **Public**: Accessible from anywhere.
2. **Private**: Accessible only within the class.
3. **Protected**: Accessible within the package and subclasses.
4. **Default**: Accessible within the package.

---

## 23. What is an Object?

An **object** is an instance of a class, representing real-world entities with properties and behaviors.

---

## 24. What is a Constructor?

A constructor initializes an object of a class:

```java
class Point {
    int x, y;
    Point(int a, int b) {
        x = a;
        y = b;
    }
}
```

---

### 24. What is the purpose of a default constructor?
A default constructor in Java is used to create objects with default values. It’s a type of constructor that doesn’t take any parameters, meaning it automatically assigns default values to the object's properties.

**Key Points:**
- Creates an object with default values.
- Called automatically when an object is initialized without specific arguments.

---

### 25. What is a copy constructor in Java?
A copy constructor is used to create a new object by copying the values of another object. This is useful when you want a duplicate of an existing object with the same property values.

**Key Points:**
- Takes another object as a parameter.
- Copies values from one object to create a similar new one.

---

### 26. Where and how can you use a private constructor?
A private constructor is used when you want to restrict the creation of objects from outside the class. This is useful in cases like Singleton patterns, where only one instance of a class should exist.

**Example:**
```java
class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance = null;
    
    // Private constructor
    private Singleton() {}
    
    // Factory method to get the instance
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null)
            instance = new Singleton();
        return instance;
    }
}
```

---

### 27. Differences between constructors and methods:
| Feature              | Constructor                                | Method                                      |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Purpose              | Initializes an object                      | Performs specific actions                   |
| Return Type          | No return type                             | Has a return type                           |
| Call Frequency       | Called only once during object creation    | Can be called multiple times                |
| Usage                | Sets up initial state of an object         | Used for performing actions on the object   |

---

### 28. What is an Interface?
An interface in Java is a collection of abstract methods and constants that define a set of behaviors a class can implement.

**Syntax:**
```java
interface MyInterface {
    // Abstract methods
    void method1();
}
```

**Example:**
```java
interface Shape {
    double getArea();
    double getPerimeter();
}

class Circle implements Shape {
    private double radius;
    public Circle(double radius) { this.radius = radius; }
    
    public double getArea() {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }

    public double getPerimeter() {
        return 2 * Math.PI * radius;
    }
}
```

---

### 29. Features of an Interface
- Achieves full abstraction by hiding implementation details.
- Supports multiple inheritance (a class can implement multiple interfaces).
- Helps in creating loosely coupled code by specifying behavior without implementation.

---

### 31. Differences between abstract class and interface:
| Feature              | Abstract Class                                | Interface                                   |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Methods              | Can have both abstract and concrete methods   | Only abstract methods (Java 8+ allows default methods) |
| Final Methods        | Can have final methods                        | No final methods                            |
| Inheritance          | Single inheritance                            | Multiple inheritance                        |
| Declaration Keyword  | `abstract`                                    | `interface`                                 |
| Visibility           | Can have private, protected, and public       | Only public methods by default              |

---

### 32. What is data encapsulation?
Encapsulation in Java is the process of wrapping data (variables) and methods (functions) together in a single unit, like a class. It hides the internal state of the object from outside access.

**Example:**
```java
class Person {
    private String name;
    
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
```

---

### 33. Advantages of Encapsulation
1. **Data Hiding**: Keeps sensitive data hidden from the outside.
2. **Increased Flexibility**: Provides read-only or write-only access.
3. **Reusability**: Easy to reuse and modify code.
4. **Testing**: Simplifies testing by controlling data access.

---

### 34. Primary benefit of Encapsulation
The main advantage of encapsulation is the protection it offers by hiding the internal state of an object from outside access and only allowing controlled interaction through public methods.

---

### 35. What is aggregation?
Aggregation represents a "has-a" relationship between classes in Java. It shows a class has a reference to another class, indicating a loose association between the two classes.

**Example:**
- A `Library` has many `Books`, so `Library` has an aggregation relationship with `Books`.

---

### 36. What is the ‘IS-A’ relationship in Java?
The `IS-A` relationship in Java represents inheritance. When a class inherits another class, it forms an `IS-A` relationship.

---

### 37. Define inheritance:
Inheritance allows a subclass (child class) to inherit properties and methods from a superclass (parent class), making it possible to reuse code.

---

### 38. Types of inheritance in Java
1. **Single Inheritance**: One subclass inherits from one superclass.
2. **Multilevel Inheritance**: A subclass is inherited by another subclass, creating a hierarchy.
3. **Hierarchical Inheritance**: One superclass is inherited by multiple subclasses.
4. **Multiple Inheritance (Interfaces only)**: A class can implement multiple interfaces.

---

### 39. What is multiple inheritance? Is it supported by Java?
Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit features from multiple parent classes. Java does not support multiple inheritance with classes but allows it with interfaces.

**Example with Interfaces:**
```java
interface A { 
void methodA(); 
}
interface B {
void methodB();
}

class C implements A, B {
    public void methodA() { /* Implementation */ }
    public void methodB() { /* Implementation */ }
}
```

---

### 40. Differences between abstract class and interface:

| Feature              | Abstract Class                                | Interface                                   |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Methods              | Can have both abstract and concrete methods   | Only abstract methods (Java 8+ allows default methods) |
| Final Methods        | Can have final methods                        | No final methods                            |
| Inheritance          | Single inheritance                            | Multiple inheritance                        |
| Declaration Keyword  | `abstract`                                    | `interface`                                 |
| Visibility           | Can have private, protected, and public       | Only public methods by default              |

Here's the version with numbering starting from 41 and continuing as requested:

---

## 41. What is Polymorphism?
**Polymorphism** means "many forms." It lets methods behave differently based on the object calling them. There are two types:
- **Compile-time polymorphism (method overloading):** The method is chosen during compile time. Example: A class `Area` can calculate areas of squares, triangles, or circles based on parameters.
- **Runtime polymorphism (method overriding):** The method is chosen at runtime, where a subclass method can override a parent class method.

## 42. What is runtime polymorphism (dynamic method dispatch)?
**Dynamic method dispatch** decides which overridden method to run based on the object type at runtime. This happens when a superclass reference points to a subclass object, and Java chooses which method to call based on the object type when the program runs.

## 43. What is method overriding?
**Method overriding** (runtime polymorphism) occurs when a subclass has a method with the same name, parameters, and return type as a parent class method. When called, the subclass method overrides the parent’s.

```java
class Vehicle {
    void drive() { System.out.println("Vehicle is driving"); }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    void drive() { System.out.println("Car is driving"); }
}

Vehicle vehicle = new Car();
vehicle.drive(); // Output: Car is driving
```

## 44. What is method overloading?
In Java, **method overloading** allows methods with the same name but different parameters to exist in a class. Known as **compile-time polymorphism** or **static polymorphism**.

```java
class MathOperations {
    static int multiply(int a, int b) { return a * b; }
    static int multiply(int a, int b, int c) { return a * b * c; }
}

MathOperations.multiply(4, 5);    // Output: 20
MathOperations.multiply(2, 3, 4); // Output: 24
```

## 45. Can we override a static method?
No, static methods belong to the class, not instances. They cannot be overridden.

## 46. Can we override an overloaded method?
Yes, overloaded methods are independent, so they can be overridden in subclasses.

## 47. Can we overload the main() method?
Yes, we can have multiple versions of the `main` method with different parameters, but only `public static void main(String[] args)` starts the program.

## 48. Method Overloading vs Method Overriding
- **Method Overloading:** Multiple methods in the same class with the same name but different parameters.

```java
class Calculator {
    int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }
    int add(int a, int b, int c) { return a + b + c; }
}
```

- **Method Overriding:** A subclass provides a specific version of a method that exists in its parent class.

```java
class Animal {
    void sound() { System.out.println("Animal sound"); }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() { System.out.println("Dog barks"); }
}
```
