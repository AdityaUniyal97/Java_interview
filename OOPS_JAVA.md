Here’s an enhanced version with lines added for a polished appearance in Obsidian:

---

### Folder: `Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)`

---

#### 1. OOP Basics

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
  OOP is a programming paradigm based on objects, representing real-world entities with attributes (data) and behaviors (methods). It makes code more modular and manageable.

  **---**

- **Why OOP?**  
  OOP provides a structured approach, making code understandable, maintainable, and reusable. It’s ideal for larger projects due to encapsulation and inheritance.

  **---**

---

#### 2. Classes and Objects

- **Class**  
  A class is a blueprint for creating objects, defining properties (data) and behaviors (methods) that each object will have.

  **---**

- **Object**  
  An object is an instance of a class, used to access the data and methods of the class. It represents real-world entities with specific attributes and actions.

  **---**

---

#### 3. Core Features of OOP (Pillars)

- **Encapsulation**  
  Encapsulation in Java is the process of wrapping data (variables) and methods (functions) together in a single unit, like a class. It hides the internal state of the object from outside access.

  **---**

- **Abstraction**  
  Abstraction hides complex implementation details and shows only essential features to the user, simplifying object interaction.

  **---**

- **Polymorphism**  
  Polymorphism allows functions to behave differently based on the object calling them. . Examples include method overloading (compile-time) and overriding (runtime).

  **---**

- **Inheritance**  
  Inheritance allows a subclass (child class) to inherit properties and methods from a superclass (parent class), making it possible to reuse code. 
  **---**

---

#### 4. Access Specifiers

- **Definition**  
  Keywords like `public`, `private`, and `protected` control the visibility and accessibility of classes, methods, and variables, supporting encapsulation.

  **---**

---

#### 5. Advantages and Disadvantages of OOP

- **Advantages**  
  Enhanced code reusability, maintainability, and data security.

  **---**

- **Disadvantages**  
  Requires planning and can be complex for smaller projects.

  **---**

---

#### 6. Other Programming Paradigms

- **Imperative Programming**  
  Focuses on *how* to achieve a result with a step-by-step approach.

  **---**

- **Declarative Programming**  
  Focuses on *what* to achieve without detailing how, using logic-based expressions.

  **---**

---

#### 7. Structured vs. Object-Oriented Programming

- **Structured Programming**  
  Organizes code in functions and modules, suitable for small programs.

  **---**

- **Object-Oriented Programming**  
  Focuses on reusable objects with state and behavior, better for larger applications.

  **---**

---

#### 8. OOP Languages

- Popular OOP languages include: Java, C++, Python, C#, JavaScript, and Ruby.

  **---**

---

#### 9. Types of Polymorphism

- **Compile-Time (Static) Polymorphism**  
  Uses method overloading or operator overloading, where binding is resolved at compile-time.

  **---**

- **Runtime (Dynamic) Polymorphism**  
  Uses method overriding, where the actual function executed is determined at runtime.

  **---**

---

#### 10. Overloading vs. Overriding

- **Overloading**  
  The same method name with different parameters (compile-time).

  **---**

- **Overriding**  
  Redefining a parent class method in the child class with the same signature (runtime).

  **---**

---

#### 11. Limitations of Inheritance

- Increases tight coupling, leading to dependencies between parent and child classes, which can complicate maintenance.

  **---**

---

#### 12. Types of Inheritance

- **Single Inheritance**: One child class inherits from one parent class.

  **---**

- **Multiple Inheritance**: One child class inherits from multiple parent classes (not supported in Java).

  **---**

- **Multilevel Inheritance**: A class derived from another derived class.

  **---**

- **Hierarchical Inheritance**: Multiple child classes inherit from a single parent class.

  **---**

- **Hybrid Inheritance**: Combines two or more types of inheritance.

  **---**

---

#### 13. Interface

- An interface contains only method declarations, which implementing classes must define. In Java, it promotes multiple inheritance.

  **---**

---

#### 14. Abstract Class vs. Interface

- **Abstract Class**: Can have both abstract and non-abstract methods; supports single inheritance.

  **---**

- **Interface**: Only abstract methods by default; supports multiple inheritance.

  **---**

---

#### 15. Memory Usage by Class

- Classes themselves don’t occupy memory; only objects do, as they initialize class members and methods upon instantiation.

  **---**

---

#### 16. Object Creation

- Not always necessary if the class has static methods; otherwise, an object is needed for non-static methods.

  **---**

---

#### 17. Structure vs. Class in C++

- Structures default to public members; classes default to private. Structures use `struct` keyword, and classes use `class`.

  **---**

---

#### 18. Constructors

- **Constructor**  
  A special method with the same name as the class, initializes objects when created.

  **---**

- **Types of Constructors in C++**  
  - **Default**: No parameters.
  - **Non-Parameterized**: No arguments.
  - **Parameterized**: Takes parameters.
  - **Copy**: Initializes an object with values from another object.

  **---**

---

#### 19. Destructor

- A special method to clean up when an object is no longer needed (C++ uses `~` symbol).

  **---**

---

#### 20. Constructor Overloading

- Multiple constructors can be defined with different parameters for flexible object initialization.

  **---**

---

#### 21. Destructor Overloading

- Not allowed; only one destructor per class.

  **---**

---

#### 22. Virtual Function

- A method in the parent class that can be overridden in a child class for dynamic behavior.

  **---**

---

#### 23. Pure Virtual Function

- An abstract method with no body, to be implemented by derived classes, defining an abstract class.

  **---**

---

#### 24. Abstract Class

- A base class meant for inheritance, with abstract and non-abstract methods, that cannot be instantiated.

  **---**
